        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a lot of hobbies, especially when it comes to sports. One of my favorite hobbies is basketball, and I really enjoy playing it. I’ve been playing for a long time, and it’s become more than just a hobby for me; I treat it as my talent. I spend a lot of time practicing, watching games, and learning from the best players. I also enjoy playing badminton, which is a sport I play with friends for fun. Even though basketball is my main sport, I like playing other sports to stay active. In addition to sports, I love cooking. I enjoy trying new recipes and making different types of food because I really like to eat. Cooking is also a way for me to relax and express my creativity. I also love listening to music, especially when I’m traveling. Music helps me relax, and I find new artists to enjoy all the time. When I travel, music makes the journey even better. I also enjoy watching movies and TV shows, especially those that are about sports, anime, and K-dramas. Sports movies motivate me and teach me more about the games. Anime and K-dramas offer interesting stories that I enjoy watching in my free time. These hobbies are not only fun, but they also help me relax and take my mind off things.
