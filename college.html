                <h2>College Years</h2>
        <p align="justify"; margin: 20px;>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that I am in <i><b>college</i></b>, I am taking the BSIT program, which surprised me 
            because I never thought about choosing this course. My first choice was nursing, but I 
            was forced to take this program instead. During my first year, I felt both nervous and 
            excited. I heard that college was really difficult and that the reality of life starts here. 
            People also said that college life is fun. My first year was fun because I met new people. 
            I made new friends, and we did many things to make our college life memorable. 
            However, college is not a joke. I need to be at school by 7:30 AM, and I go home at night 
            since I live in Pasig. Traveling is tiring because of the heavy traffic. There are times when 
            I feel exhausted, but I know I have to keep going. I am proud of myself because I 
            survived my first year. Now, I am close to becoming a third-year student. But the pressure 
            is getting heavier because the subjects are getting harder. I am struggling, especially 
            with design and programming. Some days feel overwhelming, and I doubt myself. Luckily, 
            I have friends who help me when I need it. College is tough, but I know I must push 
            through. Now, all I think about is passing and finishing college. I want to graduate so I 
            can give back to my family. I do not know what the future holds. But one thing is for 
            sure, <strong>I will make it.</strong></p>
