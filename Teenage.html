                <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During <i><b>high school</b></i>, I had no idea what to expect, but I immediately felt the 
            pressure. My dream of becoming a basketball superstar did not change. However, this 
            time, I learned to balance academics and basketball. I gained confidence and started 
            performing better in class, which I think was because of the pressure I felt. Even though 
            high school was stressful, it was still fun. There were many activities like festival dance, 
            hip-hop, and sabayang pagbigkas. I was surprised that I participated in all of them 
            without thinking I could. I had many first-time experiences in high school, making it very 
            memorable. I felt young, wild, and free. But all that fun turned into a nightmare when 
            the COVID-19 pandemic began. It ruined many lives, including mine. I lost my passion 
            because online classes were introduced, and I did not like them. For me, they were 
            draining since they were mostly paper activities. During the pandemic, I got addicted to 
            Mobile Legends. Playing ML with friends saved me from depression. We joined 
            competitive tournaments, and I even dreamed of becoming a pro. After two years, face
            to-face classes returned. I missed playing basketball and going back to school, but my 
            passion was slowly fading. The pressure became tougher, and I had no idea which strand 
            to take in senior high school. Since I was business-minded, I chose ABM because I wanted 
            to pursue accountancy. I did well in SHS and achieved a lot. I earned honors, was part 
            of the ABM men's basketball team, and won first place in intramurals. I also won a 
            pageant, which surprised me because I never thought of joining one. Our section chose 
            me as the representative, so I had no choice. We passed our business plan research, and 
            I also passed my individual business plan with a perfect grade. I graduated with honors, 
            and for the first time, I walked on stage to receive my award.</p>
